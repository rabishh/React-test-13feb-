                <li>Early Life:<p>Mangeshkar was born in a Maharashtrian Brahmin family[15] in 1929, the eldest daughter of Deenanath Mangeshkar, a Marathi and Konkani musician, and his wife Shevanti[16] in Indore (in the present-day Indore district of Madhya Pradesh and then the capital of the princely state of Indore which was part of the Central India Agency in British India). Her father, Deenanath Mangeshkar, was a classical singer and theatre actor. Her mother, Shevanti (later renamed Shudhamati), a Gujarati woman from Thalner, Bombay Presidency (now in northwest Maharashtra), was Deenanath's second wife; his first wife Narmada, who had died, was Shevanti's older sister.[17]</p></li>
                <li>Singing Career<p>In 1942, when Mangeshkar was 13, her father died of heart disease.[23] Master Vinayak (Vinayak Damodar Karnataki), the owner of Navyug Chitrapat movie company and a close friend of the Mangeshkar family, took care of them. He helped her get started in a career as a singer and actress.[24]</p></li>
